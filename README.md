# Move Generator for Hidden Move Go

A small web application for tracking hidden moves in Hidden Move Go.

## Hidden Move Go

[Hidden Move Go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?HiddenMoveGo) is a variant of the board game [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). The variant, popularized by [Nick Sibicky](http://www.sibicky.com), introduces hidden information into the game by allowing each player a certain number of "hidden moves" that are unknown to the other player.

I play this game in a few different variants:
* Standard Hidden Move Go involves each player choosing a fixed number of hidden moves prior to the start of the game.
* Handicap Hidden Move Go involves each player choosing some number of hidden moves prior to the start of the game, with fewer hidden moves (or no hidden moves) given to the stronger player.
* Random Hidden Move Go involves each player receiving a fixed number of randomly generated moves prior to the start of the game (can be combined with the Handicap variant).

## Usage

This application can be used to track hidden moves using any of the above variants in Hidden Move Go. Each player should have this page open on their own device, not visible to the other player.

* Start by choosing your game board size (9x9, 13x13, or 19x19) and your color.
* For standard Hidden Move Go, click on any empty intersection to record that point as a hidden move.
* For random Hidden Move Go, click "Generate Random Stone" to add a hidden move to a random intersection.
* Click on a stone on the board to remove it, or click "Reset" to remove all hidden moves.
